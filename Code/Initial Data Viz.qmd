## Trying some lm
```{r}
  
# Do larger populations tend to have higher oil sales?
model1 <- lm(Quantity_tons ~ Population_region, data = oil_data)
summary(model1)

# Do larger populations tend to have higher oil sales controlling for national/international trends (e.g., oil prices, policy changes, things that affect all regions)?
model2 <- lm(Quantity_tons ~ Population_region + factor(Year), data = oil_data)
summary(model2)

# Do larger populations tend to have higher oil sales controlling for national/international trends (e.g., oil prices, policy changes, things that affect all regions) and controlling for Regional differences?
model3 <- lm(Quantity_tons ~ Population_region + factor(Year) + Region, data = oil_data)
summary(model3)

# Are there regional or time-based differences in per capita oil use?
oil_data$oil_sales_per_capita <- oil_data$Quantity_tons / oil_data$Population_region
model4 <- lm(oil_sales_per_capita ~ factor(Year) + Region, data = oil_data)
summary(model4)

# Does being in the capital region increase per capita oil sales?
oil_data$oil_sales_per_capita <- oil_data$Quantity_tons / oil_data$Population_region
oil_data <- oil_data %>% 
  mutate(Capital_region = if_else(
  Region == "Höfuðborgarsvæðið", TRUE, FALSE, missing = NULL))
model5 <- lm(oil_sales_per_capita ~ Capital_region, data = oil_data)
summary(model5)

# Does being in the capital region increase per capita oil sales controlling for years?
model6 <- lm(oil_sales_per_capita ~ Capital_region + factor(Year), data = oil_data)
summary(model6)

# Does being in the capital region increase net oil sales controlling for years and population?
model6 <- lm(Quantity_tons ~ Capital_region + Population_region + factor(Year), data = oil_data)
summary(model6)
